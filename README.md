# Weather App

Simple weather app made in React and designed with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction).

Choose a city, specify a country (in case your city is in more than one country) and get the 5 days / 3 hours weather forecast, fetched from the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/a). You can also view the hourly forecast for the city you chose.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
